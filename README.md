> Show hidden files, then hide them again, from the tray on macOS.

Created this app for anyone who doesn't necessarily want to open a terminal or hunt down some menu or whatnot to show/hide hidden files. Right now, this is a dead simple app, it does only what it says (show/hide hidden files on macOS from the tray).

I also felt the need to create this app because when I was searching something to do with the `defaults` command I stumbled across this app, [Funter](https://nektony.com/products/funter), downloaded it as it is freeware, but to my dismay... I was met instantly with an ad for some other software that the company sells (I think you call that adware). I just made my own more simple and stripped down version of that idea. This is forever-freeware. I will never advertise through it to you, fyi.
